## Information about the summary choices 
The source dataset is:
http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

### The following modifications were made

1. I merged the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. I Extracted only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3. I used descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. I appropriately labelled the data set with descriptive variable names. 
5. From the data set in step 4, I created a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.


## Information about the experimental study design
The datasource was collected from: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

### Abstract:
Human Activity Recognition database built from the recordings of 30 subjects performing activities of daily living (ADL) while carrying a waist-mounted smartphone with embedded inertial sensors.

### Data Set Information:
The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data.

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain.
